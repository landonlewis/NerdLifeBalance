**We do this because life is awesome when this thing called "work" becomes another way of expressing the passions in your life.**

Open sourcing a book might seem odd but I feel like this approach to "hive-writting" can really make a good work way more amazing that what the original author (me) was able to do alone. I still reserve the right to add or remove content to keep the book congruent but there is soo much more to be said and known - the only way that will happen is through **YOU**!

About
--------------------

Getting things done is hard. Getting things done without completely destroying our work-life balance is really hard. The idea has traditionally been that if we focus on the tasks and work we will inevitably achieve our goals and everyone will be happy. Most of us can remember working some really long weeks and hitting the "goal" but not feeling very happy. It doesn't have to be this way.

The fact is that work and life are so much more than faucets we turn off and walk away from. Instead of becoming frustrated at trying to compartmentalize, we should think about making our lives more congruent. Work skills and talents should not be one-dimensional, but can be thought of as two sides of Velcro that fit together snugly.

Here's a secret: If you find something that you are genuinely excited about and you are fortunate enough to do it as a "job" you can and should share that passion with your family and friends. What if your work and life talents were not separate but simply part of who you are? 

You see, life is awesome when this thing called "work" becomes another way of expressing the passions in your life.

**The intent of this book is to:**

* Help you find the refactoring mindset for your life
* Motivate you toward finding a place that fits your passions
* Help answer that question that has been a constant hum in the back of your mind... "So now what?"
* Start a discussion so that we can all get "better" (not perfect) at this whole work-life thing.

**This book is:**

* Open sourced!
* Based on a collection of real world experience from many people
* Intentionally filled with satire and fun to help us all take ourselves a little less seriously
* Filled with Nerd and Geek culture references to illustrate our need for refactoring
* Designed to speak to anyone who is passionate about doing what they love (defined by this book as a 'nerd') but feel like they can't
* Has projects that you can do with your family and friends
* Intended to generate thinking and discussion over what this whole work life thing is supposed to be.

**This book is NOT:**

* A self-help book
* Intended to be read but never shared
* Just for "computer" nerds but rather for all nerd-kind
